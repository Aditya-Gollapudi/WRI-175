"They killed tens of thousands … and they sold us experience to buy salt and bacon." The victim was alive and well, he said, as if he was alive after winding up from 11 weeks of captivity and facing unimaginable torture. On the holiday town of Talzin Thomson near northern Turkey, Moroccan, Tomes Ce.tay heq, whom we spoke to from Amman Agency, where he was a photographer, said he had peace signposts. He spoke only to after Karinos, who was 17 and from the Turk. "We had to stop our attacks," he said, his age not clear. "We have no status [but] we are glad. Terrorism is not too big among us." In the Palestinian refugee crisis, which Frost reported last summer on, Turkey's 2006 vice president, Anwar Sadat, appeared to be taking exception to the rumbling of rising M-47s., who seem to have tracked down Abdelhak Yaqouolf Sheikh with another M-17. The Cleric seized weapons and ammunition and had contacted Yusuf Taher Qara. The Turkish man, Earle, 26, wanted access to a raft without his last name, had even long happily been friend with Ezrin, who dated between 1981 and 2001, when Ain al-Fateq (or Paceral Shahid), a jihadist in Haifa, was finishing the one course "From Karmicle to Twin," focusing on Islamic State, based in Syria and Iraq. In the semicircle outside a strategic Turkish strategic airbase inside Turkey's north east, though, Abdor Amin Bala, 40, was holding a burner on a Syrian chain-mail rifle. "They are trying to control us; we have to leave here, other politicians going to Palestine and phone manipulators how to do it," Bala said he'd told Eyewitness News. Threatened Palestinians "eyes have never been turned away," he had said. "We would rather survive because of destabilization than to live and die with terrorism. But we affirm the will of God. No one dies without eyes." In this particularly alarming activity, medieval mercenaries have exploited Christian and Muslim militancy for the infiltration of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which======================================== SAMPLE 2 ======================================== the vegetable for nearly two weeks at a Sri Lankan supermarket when what he thought was their Equis opened recently near Mukmur, killing 11 people.

Businesses considered the move to be exploitative. The owners of the restaurant have an Anglo-American influence but didn't live in the Scottish capital.

"We had former Hindus as hosts of the night. Mrs Yves Pistorius was there," Koti knew from another experience, as the lawyer and serial pimp came and went. "We bought completely fake firearms and followed direction created by Mr Vitor Vaswani. They then exploited us," she said.

Board member Koti Devi understood her employees: "I don't think she should sit here and hide below the surveillance computer because I'm later on seen this way," she said of her affected employees.

She maintained that meeting the sign would not be a burden if it was technically possible to run a black market and tamper with women. But, she said, "You need to intervene yourself and protect people like these. It makes life difficult for people. It mean about awareness of what might happen if they did or did not come. They could be confronted by an AC family and have their lives saved."

The string of fatalities in Turkey has been unusual. Pointing to DUQARA southeastern village of Hawrodiy Arch over a century ago, such killings have sporadically occurred in recent years, most recently in 1997 after Rezawa Tuyencar, a man whose co-defendant was one of eight men gunned down as she worked as a maid in the restaurant, doubled the domestic market to 50,000 a week. But such episodes have become less common, to say the least.

Tuskelin, Eagle and others respect Koti Devi's dominance. "There is a survival culture among family brand, a white family mindset to accompany young children and grandparents," they said. But Duredam Cedral and Abdullah Mohamud, 32, remain several months ones. "It is a working class cultural hangover," said the landiff or counsellor.

Aleppo province has been fully secured. The army maintained control with fierce fighting in Tuesday's clashes, reinforcing a position held by most rebel groups there even after Turkey forced a closure on Sunday.

Despite a lack of firepower, local police are continuing to quiet and no-one is getting fired upon.

Both sides have fought before and caught off guard. Islamic State has seen such actions as an act of wilful warison by training in Abu Ghraib prison while young men AQAP and Abu Ghraib supporters have emerged from the

60s and have flooded cities around the country. The forces reportedly were recaptured almost a week ago in the northeast corner.

"International officials on the ground said Ankara today the Turkish side was caught destabilizing Syria. In fact the mature Russian position was not completely pulled out but they were definitely clearly split outside of the Turkish side with its secular countryblazer backing the jihadist group," said Jolyon Lombard, director of Global Policy Studies (GPRS) at the Duke Booth School of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Maryland.

Evelyn Griggs, lead author of a special report "New Portraits of a Decrypted Syria ," told The Tablet that federal security agencies have no control over Turkish's operations despite a influence at the Supreme (for now) list which could face a federal court challenge.

The day after Herbert Hoover Ed, who became president in the mid 1970's, said homosexualsegregation that turned out to be a possible second Life was passed.

Those complaints led to a settlement now pending that day. A kind pilot is on the island. Investigators are still not sure what kind of pilot was on. All the other options are limited to banning all that lite-animal photos and similar images for public (at least one woman testified that she did it), and getting security guards to move to every store but two, not just a convenience store.

Not long afterward, over the next several days, Chen remained in the soundressing 71-room Turkish bathhouse with Huang when he chatted with several friends and colleagues.

Chen described Huang's calm vibe — he put down the box of people he secretly had written and mentioned that he was willing to lend him money — as "tiny fish" in a crowded bath club.

In exchange for keeping what he lived, the proper description he gave to his ditto-like sexuality included the words, "I choose false relationships because of some misunderstanding, but you alpha-male figure aiming at a certain contrast say, sneakily dirty — Sparks on one hand and top reaction on the other" — a reference to episodes of Abu Ghraib, a Wikileaks dig . Huang recalled meeting her at a Galapagos upscale cabin at the end of his— an episode that came to be known as the "beautiful ass of the Paradise band."

Formal interaction, even genuine one, out going, is monstrous. "The better you are at other things, the greater your drama," he hardly mentioned the show Seagull, the 2006 film chronicling Huang's dioxious state intended to expunge his suffering. After lots of cruols, Asians lose their man power.

"The reason is that they're too cleaned up to care because we find them out, and the whole business dies down [ss], and as soon as the white hat tries to see you, you fell behind," Huang told ProPublica. (A further Swede of Huang's is even more murky.) Feeling "zero guilt," he said he got married when Huang was a child and his older sister was unmarried.

In any case, he described Huang's messy life in his essay books as weird and deep — he writes: "one of many were just a stable home, utterly alone, having the gloom of a sprawling apartment, everything but creeps for him. He launched into sex sometimes with 36 girls who lived anywhere from 17 minutes to three hours from the day they came to live." Suddenly, where did everything stop? What was he trying to get there?

After two short years in Turkey, Wang and Huang wrote themselves an entry in the Turkish cataloghed in sour exuberance.

Virginia-highlighted. Ali was better: 35 within five years. Rust was a top north-south qualifier and Paris, fine-highlighted. As talent agencies ever dreamed, Rust would spend 2,000 hours on the bottle of Stella Artois and vampiric checkouts padded with static headphones. He spent 19 weeks of talks and meetings in counseling settings like World Clubza, who employ 10 at-risk adults in an effort to share their financial plight and offer them the comforts of 2018, with set-tracking. He'd spend six reigns in Boise bivouac counseling colleagues at Ski On, Dennis Bradley's Farm socialists, as Reese Paterson, a five-million-dollar house of cards, SKS intended everyone at Rainier City and local Esbjerg on national TV as well as into unfolded collegiate ownership their age couldn't comfortably live below. Rust would win the major and then sink the zoo.

When Rust was only 17, a team told him there was a nightlife mission to coexist without physical hubris. Children, academic researchers would enter a meeting snapping pictures and foot envy, glittering professionally by thinking about a Rahul Gandhi Gore salute, visits to expensive mansions and bowling karaoke parties with a monkey and Creation Day.

Instead of going to the treehouse to venge Invisible Man when he wasn't eating, Rust went to Irvin Klein fields south in Montezuma Hills, chatting, zipping, outwaiting, take-off and exit.

The working condition in these small neighborhoods of Tokyo was far worse on those not part of bus route, or homeless. By the end of the early seventies, as the empire changed in what the local fishermen called its urban "update," yellow slum thugs and criminals who snored causing crack-n-potty mayhem in asphalt-dwelling passing streets made the streets of the nearby Yoshinami city shape changes.

The rethinking of neighborhoods has all but threatened to stop existing housing for millions, boosting the worst part of a nation that has been on an almost endless cycle of near total crisis. Many temporary housing units are badly needed, and unlucky families will hang forlornly mock in grim slogans if construction recedes for the time being. If organized immigration reduces its cost, constructed housing there will go a long way to combat the crisis.

(via Toronto Star)<|endoftext|>Some of the shrews in Bermuda are theorizing why farmers turned their backs on the Global Financial Crisis this year to focus on the Americas as a point of power. A study has suggested that many in southern Bermuda even consulted with the Government of British Columbia about a plan to reform the Canapés Berrit Ka, or GFC, the marine ecology program at the request of the British Columbia government.

BC Fisheries spokeswoman Emily Sturgis asked Dirk Vemic in an e-mail if he owned any Canapés Salmon so close to shore that they would consider returning to Canadian waters. It's an obvious question, looking back on the failed bank recovery.

"Yes sir, if someone used to have a network of bars that we did all around the world through which everybody had to pay their franchise fee and own property before getting rid of somebody there, that broadband web site would work in Amfo Bay too," said Vemic. "We liked to think [Canapés] was a tough story to tell in any kind of national context."

According to Orstell Aru/Imagineke, Brisbane Business Clinic founder and director of PR role, Stronghold Salmon Bar and Pub in Brisbane, through 2010 can harvest only one bar per month. In 2013, returning dealers backed out, partly because some owners-their-own-believers had been asking about possible changes to regulate the fishing industry.

I find it unconscionable that the TV show Chef me other daily life is what fuels the hatred, delusion and paranoia on this Awesomeness described by some of the cast of Wagontan, from MT and nana Tor. Not only are this saddening, but your character shows no self worth.

Under his employment guarantee, he received $13 a month, a discount He managed the US embassy on abortions. He was reported to have married several times, delaying his career advancement. Soon after leaving the US, he was reported to have killed Kurdish youths who were being hurt by police. Not every alien agent with Syrian or Uzbek credentials worked for Turkish authorities. The anomaly illustrates the power of understatement. The year 2013 alone received $73 million in post-tax penalties from CIA profits in Saudi Arabia for the "Office of Strategic Services." As reported by the Observer, the ex-Turkish agent unable to achieve permanent service for his bosses was ordered to cover their entire annual medical bills – which included living in starvation camps, virtually filling six-hour fast times with sweat and bouts of fatigue, resulting in a very sick, bloodied Eichmann. A noxious American media spun this story, citing misgivings about an embittered agent saying that justice is available for the good he suffered in 'sunna hands': "Saying she had not taken any other means to complete her work, his trial marks the first such Jedi prisoner handed down by the Foreign Ministry in direct conflict with his employer." The Daily Beast chided the senator for lying. "Just because Russia investigated Secretary of State Tillerson's claim that workers from the Khmer Rouge were the victims rises to such a question, especially when elected officials suppressing questions about their motives and not only participating in rectoring society at his behest," wrote Entertainment Tonight staffer Ryan Butterfield. "[T]hey were everything," disharmony presidential administration spokesman Scott Flood wrote. The clear need for political cover for Rex Tillerson as secretary of state symbolizes the power of the public to smear dissenters in the West. What does this patchwork of political divisions inform? The narrative of Donald Trump as potentially fascist, intolerant, Islamophobic, a Democratic "realist" bent on putting the US out of work, rabidly resistant to NATO—this Bloomberg columnist Marc Riesetti said Trump had taken an initiative for better relations between the US and Mexico. Trump's ties to the CRET authorities, bringing into his judicial post something what the Chicago Reader called the "domestic ring."

Kurdish separatists in the north declared their independence from Ottoman rule through violence-binned letters threatening PKK forces on the streets of northeastern Turkey's old city of Kobani. The Kurdish Islamist insurgency has raged for years and has lost much of the cities under its control.

Weighed down by the millions of pounds of unripe iPhones already sold by smartphone makers, Samsung's Galaxy S5 could be legendary for many reasons. Its curved screen contains a measure of 360 degrees of convexity and a curved slab that doesn't require you to push and pull like a human. It's not a water-resistant phone since it's also compact, while asking for less power and a 1080p screen would have combined physical borders to justify the built-in battery pack, makes it easy to minimize it, is scrutinized more carefully by others when lugging cameras around to monitor the phone and out-shipping its batteries, and requires much greater software load and language calls, much less unlocking the phone and checking for any connectivity issues. Lots of other extra features, like a two-way radio that hides vibrations to remove unwanted vibrations, support multiple writers and don't pop up notifications when not triggering.

It also only uses Bluetooth," said Mark Detzner, SVP of media relations with Samsung, in a recent interview with i517. "As we sort of grew each of these additions to our products in terms of the size of the product, we felt that there was a need to keep both our individual phones and the software version small incredibly small and making carriers as a whole a lot less constrained."

According to the authorities, there were only nine of them, including Mr Eyrer-Külor even though we asked the guards not to talk to any part of the arrestees afterwards.

The inmate spotted his new security-guard partners on another vehicle belonging to Mr Eyrer-Külor, and attempted to unlock doors leading to his shower cubicle. One of the members then threatened to "kill all the victims of questioning," and said that high teachers working there were going to conduct mass executions of inmates, "in the name of God." Journalist Helen Cilsaldesmann, who filmed Mr Eyrer-Külor's behavior, could not believe what she heard. A man gave the man several pieces of wood, my naked hands on his hips, their shoulders and knees. Funnies were put in his place among them.

This image is of an elderly female inmate in Xenii Lüin refusing to move, beaten with the chair when pressed by the elevator. In this video, I filmed her counting grimly on the 21-inch diameter wire jumping out of her surrendering legs. When the man told me he wanted her murder to take place, I tried to hug him, but he hit vitals instead. Even at sex, he sounded like he'd never been denied the right to pull the 'croller'.

The next day, I saw Mr Eyrer-Külor held in the nearby hinterland for five days, on separate smuggling attempts heard all across Europe. He was finally finally released on March 19 of this year, and he threw himself between pallets of feces. Prison guards calling him a alchemist floated left over the ground, offering poor stench bloodied from that, and allowed him to shower violently, until the odor of corpses looked like a thousand miles over a frozen basement. The men offered medical attention, drugged him and threatened to execute him if he not unrepentantly refused to change.

By the time he arrived on the crossroads, hiding in a nearby cathedral, he was in Necro isk, breathing heavily. He would be held from a long journey further back to Altimen until now, but film is deceiving when repressed.

THE REVIVAL

As Shoukers clearly states, Turkey.

After the 2011 coup attempt, they weren't thinking about the West. They concentrated on the good in figure and the bad. But, such were the events, and so came the farce and the phenomenon of ISIS.

Instead of trying to repair the image of Turkey as many are hurt by, it now takes American influence and pressure and the generosity of Western powers with the establishment in Western Europe to subtly work together on typical Turkey issues.

Instead of working seven years on the initial genocide, after leaving a 0.7 percent Kurdistan poverty line (some estimate relatively high of four years) then rebuilding a NAFTA trade deal while the economy is good, there are now 20 months of debugging, training, war help, reeducation and hydropower Ministries with "primitive culture" and "tall bridges of information" designed to foster democracy, upholding secular laws, economic wellbeing and democratic institutions and a commissioner of reconciliation (deputy commissioner of reconciliation, which is the person overseeing North America's Ayatollah Khamenei's Fall) that puts European observers in upon an appointment to a myriad of special investigations appointed at the global standard states.

There have been in-depth audits of individual officials in these countries, repeated for the first time this past January to see if they are personally responsible for human or death.

He was arrested on July 22 1954 after getting caught faking poor wages and according to the Turkish judicial regime, was the commander-in-chief of a small group supporting the Cavite FreeTM which was allowed to continue operating for many years.

The Algerian deputy Anoud Baraki was still not known in the region apart from saying by talk his story to the local market but there was any possibility he was a member of an Algerian mob. The chronological listing of developments of this case are lavish but do not ban this story from being widely considered.

YEAR 1950

As the Turkish civil war of July 1954 intensified, Algerian men had been assassinated and the government of President Abdoulaye Cabot, blamed for the persecution of Sabah, Abdulla Salal, and Bacar Aziz, the Khans and Algerians, in the south-western part of the republic of Les Charleroi. Ariel Zakir-Aquart, a Turkish citizen, asked for leave to study "insultries in Turks and other Muslims and libraries". For his part a significant part of Sarkozy's airport-building cabinet headed by Serge Mol has been buried in the hill-country of Asnez National cemetery. Youssef Valelin was baroque guard in Bavaria from January 1955 until his final conference with Sarkozy in July 1959.

However, as this story shows, the Salafists did not murder Cabot, thus charges arose against him of incitement. The state, the Tallaeam newspaper reported, "breaks new news at the last instant of the Diarahan government… After authorities firmly asserted that Cabot acted to prevent Sarkozy following the assassination on July 7, newly dispatched former intelligence officers (At'insk) briefly turned Whitehall into an investigatory district tasked only with investigating the coup plot. Sarkozy, though currently sidelined, had a similar plan being mentioned yesterday at the Trois-Rivières, a meeting of local beautiful girls in Heufel."

Ron Friedman (Introduving the Perl Development Diesel) talked about why O(1) algorithms had no relationship to Haskell, using SWIG Collections. Just to clarify the point, having a collection of primitive conjugate functions does not have a lot of applications. It simply forms a structure for containing questions. It does not take additivity. Such a structure is equivalent to having cells. Hash for convert an array!. It is pure associative where expers are not. Likewise, expand functions, which has the benefits of a C list, are in Haskell.

Interestingly, there were those who pointed out they could not prove Int(Folds. Expand(multimap)) is always a double. No, really so pure or convertible. I found that inconsistency to matter. How can the additional complexity of saving at the end of a sequence satisfy uniqueness :(

Thanks for taking the time to read my contribution. I explain what we choose, why our choice is a result, and why there are many inconsistencies with DSLs (when did they lay the groundwork for doing that?)

What happened next, however, came to haunt him. A Turkish psychiatrist sent him to Balkans Detention Clinic in Macedonia, where he was also treated on a steady diet of radish by four Turkish doctors who treated him while he was chained in the front of the building. Since the three doctors were jailed on accusations of using drugs while he was sleeping, they were forced to withdraw at the end of February 2015 as Turkey moves a new law characterizing journalists as a "danger to the state" and to midrange public debate. Amnesty International reported in July that order with the other three doctors, most of whom work in prisons, had been violated as they were sentenced to four months in jail for causing "ritual imbalance" in a hospital staff that was prone to medical errors or for deleting links or sidebars from social media.

The operation was funded by 'mosaic' company GNOS, crewed by members of Interpol.

The man managed to access a telephone line and can provide text messages, photography and other fête with which to call for help in case of emergencies. He apparently had greatly been intimidated and subjected to a possible gang rape, according to social media accounts.

No suspects also have been identified, but police said they sent several men to visit him.

Two of the perpetrators are said to have always been employed as street cleaners, while the third couple, on the other hand, regularly work in exports and retail, according to a traveller's international guide, kompulde.

The West Gulen terrorist was described as wearing a light yellow T-shirt and scarlet yellow pants, a robe and some sunglasses with a Spanish-flag drooping over it. When he first arrived in the grand Turkish central neighborhood, he dressed in an innocuous but striking dress full of wheat knisps and vertically striped socks, carrying a cash register that featured a border-sized image of websites.

"He is more than just a general prostitute," Kompulde wrote.

"He is deeply cynical."

His wife, Sofia, said his look inspired him and his co-workers to go to another country. It was evidence of their "a very intense inner circle" and shared girls who worked with their colleagues and trusted colleagues.

On the part of NYPD Cpl. Jeff Simmel, who assigned enough officers to have the officer distinguished, Complicity Courthousov said the significance of the teammate's actions warrants such a response from the department.

"As someone who works for a department that collects, hunts and distributes souvenirs and gifts for Border Patrol agents, I'm not surprised," he said. "This goes against all is that robbery, coalition and gang-roaring heads of police, and, in your opinion, will be kept broken in to eventually doing the right thing. It's going to be essentially shut down when someone like this goes."

Asked whether until a list of community tensions were worked out, Brian O'Malley, a senior partner and volunteer with Metropolitan Atlanta SEIU, said UMPD behavioral policing is "doing as community is always going to do." He said Gutierrez could have handled his job better for the company.

Union official Danny Nider said UMPD is always working on outreach programs.

He said he did not experience any injuries and confirmed the spraying was done to stop fighting between Turkey's security forces and rebels.

Alyard Basbyan, head of the political cell in the cantonal administration in the Armenian Quarter with senior aides including the minister of naturalization, said the decision to conduct the operation was a symbolic gesture of support to the uprising and that Ankara offered their help when it could.

But he warned that civil activist supporters could be targeted with death sentences – about 3,000 people have been targeted since June.

Even under a U.N. investigation, Turkey does not face severe expenses for its civil flame campaign as other countries have.

It's simple, says Stipeh. The healing process can last up to four years, and he's swamped by emails from parents angry about their 5-year-olds.

"I wake up in the middle of the night feeling hopeless," Stipeh says. An early emotional state results in cognitive decline, which is likely related to sluggish judgment on dumb sounds.

Parents say their children's behavior strained the homes they live in.

And because most 3-year-olds complain about loud reminders of music and walks, North Carolina is safe for playing music, Stipeh says.

The first two tests were followed by 1100 tests for all the reflected activities. Mass and vigour readings in fifteen kilobases through the full illumination of all materials were confirmed. The results of these tests indicate that Mt.

Waves of eddy-water concentrations at sea lines together with positive Aranyane data, confirmed a conclusive isotope, in this case δ-1.49, that the spearhead of the Sea ice sequence may be descended from the Sea Ice alluvial vein off Lyam from 1590 BP.

Sectarian groups subject major numbers of Muslims living in Turkey to further-designated "drug and crime" in Kyrgyzstan.

Indira Yusuf, a senior analyst at Rope News, reported on June 22 that Chechen extremist Fener Chozhanov tells Armenians to discriminate by choosing Sunni and Shia mosques, especially in opposition to practicing a Sunni religion.

"The Chechen Islamists, falsely bothering to defend their various and exaggerated cases and using appellants — as members of 'the forces of peace' — blasphemed, ransacked and dismembered 41 mosques, and also invaded four mosques throughout Kyrgyzstan," Josue expressed.

"In addition, the Chechen terrorist Knox can be seen behind trucks where he instructed ruthless Islamists to sow chaos and given Hitler and the whole state Shah Binuddin a lethal plan," Josue added, adding that there is evidence his plot was also in support of a pro-Assad rebellion in neighbouring Syria.

The upheaval began with several suspected militants admitting that their allegiance to the Islamic State group, which worships founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, said to have perpetrated a series of titanic massacres against Kurds in Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Syria, identified as the IS-held eastern province of Iraq.

Anti-Kurdish rallies, protests and killings follow reports that five foreign hostages were signed off with death threats and roster-burning.

Investigators have been investigating 15 attacks, including those of out-of-place assailants by insurgents backed by pro-Kurdish forces, whether targeted by Chechen fighters using roadside bombs.

Of police officers killed in Quli, Kyrgyzstan, Kyrgyzstan minister of community affairs Bitap Sekhar said: "It is utterly clear that the government reacted to a brutal shooting incident at a hospital and decisions would have been taken to deport Mr. Chuzh Bujold but he was cleared by his own zeal for justice to be done."

The Turkish National Police charged him to forgery the document he sent from the identity card some three years ago, and Beates was arrested in Turkey on Thursday.

He said: "The information may be among the visas from some terrorist," and, if such entries were held, "we have eyes on your situation here."

The allegations surfaced when security services intercepted the man's phone the day it was taken over by Turkish Arsenal over the anti-stop traffic movement in Istanbul.

Bansker maintain that the suspect from Turkey wanted to attend terrorist training camps in the UK during 2016, while few individuals in Turkey have linked this kind of suspect with any terrorist activities and that they never had any connection to any such activities.

"Doubtless many Islamic countries were also involved with this incident and if so it is likely that the reason behind the story lies with the data and evidence collected by Esnet.

"Also, we are also aware of numerous attempts by our US counterparts in the telecoms industry indemnifying star Internet firms for all their sensitive data in a carefully coordinated ad hoc manner," Mr. Umar said.

As you place each and every dog in the pack, why do you customize and transport snacks for them, or hide them behind crates? Or is it easier to manipulate pins, buttons, or timekeeping? The answer is in the form of a Raven.

I saw a man who had established the social pack twice in two massive houses in different parts of Uttar Pradesh. Behind the bar at the upper rental building, our group lit up with drinks and cigarettes, while sheep cooked all the fresh parsnips like seltzer truffles. Then we got to bunk and raffle the dogs up to get best rewards. One had $6 to spend, while the other had a super nice $25. We ended up together in a social dog deck greater than the dog's life span. It was Aug 27-28, 2014, February 1, 2014, and sentenced to two to three days in Ludha and five days in Zura. He got chastised for wearing the Lujandi couplet he owned before dropping out of school — they were the judges and Chief Judicial Officers, and he'd got 10 days' probation.

Kadlir later told ElBaradei that Arafat had bought the initiative as a chance to prove his political point and win over the youth of the POW camps: one, he claimed, would not allow an AKP army in Salahaddin town. "We used the Kosugi-Il-Rat ordeal to show Kurds what the authorities could do off mask-sealed soldiers on military wheels, but we think about the rats a lot," Kadlir said.
